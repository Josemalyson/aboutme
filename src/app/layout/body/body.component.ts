In 2010 I started my degree in Computer Science at UnipÃª. In 2012 I participated in the software factory composed of students from the IT courses from there I went to the internship in the CREA-PB federal body of the Brazilian government being assigned to the technology area of the same. So in 2012 I was selected for the Phoebus Technology Company to be technical support working with Oracle PL / SQL and SqlServer. Then started my search for the development area where I had the first opportunity in Indra Brazil when I started my career as a developer in 2015, so I grew professionally and was invited to join the software development team of Stefanini in 2017. Today I always look for the better for my family trying to be the best and most committed professional in the company."
